            Spaghetti carbonara

          <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';">
            Ingredients: 100g pancetta 50g pecorino cheese 50g parmesan 3 large
            eggs 350g spaghetti 2 plump garlic cloves, peeled and left whole 50g
            unsalted butter sea salt and freshly ground black pepper
          </p>
          <p>
            Method: STEP 1 Put a large saucepan of water on to boil. STEP 2
            Finely chop the 100g pancetta, having first removed any rind. Finely
            grate 50g pecorino cheese and 50g parmesan and mix them together.
            STEP 3 Beat the 3 large eggs in a medium bowl and season with a
            little freshly grated black pepper. Set everything aside. STEP 4 Add
            1 tsp salt to the boiling water, add 350g spaghetti and when the
            water comes back to the boil, cook at a constant simmer, covered,
            for 10 minutes or until al dente (just cooked). STEP 5 Squash 2
            peeled plump garlic cloves with the blade of a knife, just to bruise
            it. STEP 6 While the spaghetti is cooking, fry the pancetta with the
            garlic. Drop 50g unsalted butter into a large frying pan or wok and,
            as soon as the butter has melted, tip in the pancetta and garlic.
            STEP 7 Leave to cook on a medium heat for about 5 minutes, stirring
            often, until the pancetta is golden and crisp. The garlic has now
            imparted its flavour, so take it out with a slotted spoon and
            discard. STEP 8 Keep the heat under the pancetta on low. When the
            pasta is ready, lift it from the water with a pasta fork or tongs
            and put it in the frying pan with the pancetta. Don’t worry if a
            little water drops in the pan as well (you want this to happen) and
            don’t throw the pasta water away yet. STEP 9 Mix most of the cheese
            in with the eggs, keeping a small handful back for sprinkling over
            later. STEP 10 Take the pan of spaghetti and pancetta off the heat.
            Now quickly pour in the eggs and cheese. Using the tongs or a long
            fork, lift up the spaghetti so it mixes easily with the egg mixture,
            which thickens but doesn’t scramble, and everything is coated. STEP
            11 Add extra pasta cooking water to keep it saucy (several
            tablespoons should do it). You don’t want it wet, just moist. Season
            with a little salt, if needed. STEP 12 Use a long-pronged fork to
            twist the pasta on to the serving plate or bowl. Serve immediately
            with a little sprinkling of the remaining cheese and a grating of
            black pepper. If the dish does get a little dry before serving,
            splash in some more hot pasta water and the glossy sauciness will be
            revived.

          <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';">
            Ingredients: 2 tbsp chopped olives or sundried tomatoes - whatever
            you've got 1 garlic clove , crushed ½ tsp dried mixed herbs 200g tub
            full-fat soft cheese 4 plump boneless, skinless chicken breasts 4
            ripe tomatoes , sliced olive oil , for drizzling
          </p>
          <p>
            Method: STEP 1 Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. Beat the olives or
            sundried tomatoes, garlic and almost all the herbs into the cheese,
            then season. Cut a slit along the side of each chicken breast, then
            use your knife to open it out into a pocket. STEP 2 Stuff each
            breast with a quarter of the cheese mix, then press to close. Lift
            onto a greased baking tray. Season the top of the chicken, then
            overlap tomato slices over the top of each piece of chicken. Season,
            then scatter with the remaining herbs. Drizzle with olive oil. STEP
            3 Roast for 20 mins until the chicken is golden around the edges and
            the tomatoes look a little shrivelled. Serve with a green salad and
            crusty bread to mop up the juices.

          <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';">
            Ingredients: 150g plain flour 1 tbsp golden caster sugar large pinch
            bicarbonate of soda ½ tsp cinnamon 1 tsp cocoa powder (optional) 30g
            butter 1 egg, separated 50ml dry marsala or white wine rapeseed oil
            or sunflower oil for deep-frying (see tip) 50g dark chocolate,
            melted handful pistachio kernels, finely chopped icing sugar, to
            dust For the filling 250g ricotta, drained and beaten until fluffy
            100g mascarpone 2 tbsp finely chopped candied peel 2 tbsp icing
            sugar
          </p>
          <p>
            Method: STEP 1 Tip the flour, sugar, bicarb, cinnamon and cocoa (if
            using) into a bowl with a pinch of salt. Add the butter and rub it
            into the dry ingredients until there are no more lumps. Mix the egg
            yolk and marsala and add this to the bowl, then mix the whole lot
            together and knead to a smooth dough. Wrap and rest in the fridge.
            (Can be made ahead and fried the next day.) STEP 2 Fill a deep-fat
            fryer, wok or deep saucepan a third of the way up with oil. Cut the
            dough into pieces and, working one piece at a time, roll them out as
            thinly as you can – use a pasta machine if you have one. Heat the
            oil and keep an eye on it until it reaches 180C. Lay the dough out
            on a lightly floured surface and cut out circles about 11cm across.
            Wrap each one around a cannoli mould, using some of the egg white to
            stick the top edge down and they're ready for frying. It's important
            to take care when cooking with hot oil. Read our guide on how to
            deep-fry safely to avoid accidents in the kitchen. STEP 3 Deep-fry
            the cannoli (with their moulds) one at a time, making sure they cook
            all over. They should take about 45-60 seconds in all and should be
            visibly golden brown (keep cooking a little longer if they aren't)
            and the dough will bubble and blister. Carefully take each one out
            of the oil using the tongs and shake the cannoli off the mould very
            carefully onto kitchen paper. As you fry each one, make sure the oil
            stays at 180C at all times and doesn’t get any hotter. These will
            keep for 2-3 days in an airtight container. STEP 4 When the cannoli
            are cold, dip the end of each one into chocolate, then dip some of
            those into the pistachios. Leave to cool and harden. Beat the
            ricotta and mascarpone together, then stir in the candied peel and
            sugar. Spoon the mixture into a piping bag with a wide star nozzle
            and pipe it into the cannoli. Serve soon after filling.
