        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';">
          Ingredients 350g self-raising flour 1 tbsp baking powder ¼ tsp salt
          50g butter , cut in pieces 1 tbsp olive oil 8 halves Italian sundried
          tomatoes , coarsely chopped 100g feta cheese , cubed 10 black olives ,
          pitted and halved 300ml full fat milk 1 egg , beaten, to glaze
        </p>
        <p>
          Method STEP 1 Heat the oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7. Butter a large
          baking sheet. In a large bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder
          and salt. Rub in the butter with the oil, until the mixture resembles
          fine crumbs, then add the tomatoes, cheese and olives. Make a well in
          the centre, pour in the milk and mix with a knife, using a cutting
          movement, until it becomes a soft ‘stickyish’ dough. (Use all the milk
          – it helps give a light texture.) Don’t overhandle the dough. STEP 2
          Flour your hands and the work surface well, and shape the dough into a
          round, about 3-4cm thick. Cut into eight wedges and place them well
          apart on the baking sheet. Brush with beaten egg and bake for 15-20
          mins until risen, golden and springy to the touch. Transfer to a wire
          rack and cover with a clean tea towel to keep them soft. These are
          best served warm and buttered. Will keep for 2-3 days in an airtight
          container.

          Mediterranean fish gratins

        alt="Tomato" />
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';">
          Ingredients 3 tbsp olive oil 1 large onion , thinly sliced 1 fennel
          bulb (about 250g/9oz), trimmed and thinly sliced 3 large garlic cloves
          , finely sliced 1 heaped tsp coriander seeds , lightly crushed 150ml
          white wine 2 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes with herbs 2 tbsp tomato
          purée good pinch of saffron 1 bay leaf 1 tbsp fresh lemon juice 1
          small bunch flat-leaf parsley , leaves roughly chopped 900g mixed
          skinless fish fillets, (anything you like) cut into chunks 350g raw
          peeled king prawn 75g finely grated parmesan 50g panko or coarse dried
          breadcrumbs green salad , to serve (optional)
        </p>
        <p>
          Method STEP 1 Heat the oil in a large, wide non-stick saucepan or
          sauté pan and gently fry the onion, fennel, garlic and coriander seeds
          for 15 mins, stirring regularly until the vegetables are softened and
          lightly coloured. Pour the wine into the pan and add the tomatoes,
          tomato purée, saffron and bay leaf. Season and bring to a gentle
          simmer. Cook for about 15 mins, stirring occasionally, until thick.
          STEP 2 Heat oven to 220C/200C fan/gas 7. Stir the lemon juice and most
          of the parsley into the tomato mixture, pop the raw fish pieces and
          prawns on top and stir well. Cover tightly with a lid and simmer
          gently over a medium heat for 4-5 mins or until the fish is almost
          cooked. Stir a couple of times as the fish cooks, taking care not to
          let it break up. STEP 3 Ladle the hot tomato and fish mixture into 6
          individual pie dishes – they will each need to hold around 350ml. Mix
          the cheese, breadcrumbs, remaining parsley and a little ground black
          pepper together and sprinkle over the top. Bake on a baking tray for
          20 mins or until the pies are golden brown and bubbling. Serve with
          green salad, if you like.

          Mediterranean turkey-stuffed peppers
        </h2>
        <img
        src=https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/30/2020/08/red-pepper-a97ba7d.jpg?quality=90&webp=true&resize=300,272
        alt="Tomato" />
        <p style="font-family: 'Courier New';">
          Ingredients 2 red peppers (about 220g) 1 ½ tbsp olive oil, plus an
          extra drizzle 240g lean turkey breast mince (under 8% fat) ½ small
          onion, chopped 1 garlic clove, grated 1 tsp ground cumin 3-4
          mushrooms, sliced 400g can chopped tomatoes 1 tbsp tomato purée 1
          chicken stock cube handful fresh oregano leaves 60g mozzarella, grated
          150g green vegetables (spinach, kale, broccoli, mangetout or green
          beans), to serve
        </p>
        <p>
          Method STEP 1 Heat oven to 190C/170C fan/gas 5. Halve the peppers
          lengthways, then remove the seeds and core but keep the stalks on. Rub
          the peppers with a drizzle of olive oil and season well. Put on a
          baking tray and roast for 15 mins. STEP 2 Meanwhile, heat 1 tbsp olive
          oil in a large pan over a medium heat. Fry the mince for 2-3 mins,
          stirring to break up the chunks, then tip onto a plate. STEP 3 Wipe
          out your pan, then heat the rest of the oil over a medium-high heat.
          Add the onion and garlic, stir-fry for 2-3 mins, then add the cumin
          and mushrooms and cook for 2-3 mins more. STEP 4 Tip the mince back
          into the pan and add the chopped tomatoes and tomato purée. Crumble in
          the stock cube and cook for 3-4 mins, then add the oregano and season.
          Remove the peppers from the oven and fill them with as much of the
          mince as you can. (Don’t worry if some spills out it – it will go
          satisfyingly crisp in the oven.) Top with the cheese and return to the
          oven for 10-15 mins until the cheese starts to turn golden. STEP 5
          Carefully slide the peppers onto a plate and serve alongside a pile of
          your favourite greens blanched, boiled or steamed.
